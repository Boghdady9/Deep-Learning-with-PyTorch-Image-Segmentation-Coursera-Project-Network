# Human Segmentation using UNet with EfficientNet Encoder in PyTorch

This project aims to segment human images using the UNet model with EfficientNet encoder in PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of human images and their corresponding masks. The goal is to accurately segment the human from the background in the images.

# Data
The dataset used in this project consists of human images and their corresponding masks. The images are in RGB format and have a resolution of 256x256 pixels. The masks are binary images with the same resolution as the input images.

# Model Architecture
The UNet model is used for image segmentation, with EfficientNet encoder as the backbone. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, with skip connections between them. The encoder extracts features from the input image, while the decoder upsamples the features to generate the output mask.

# Training
The model is trained using two loss functions: DiceLoss and BCEWithLogitsLoss. The training data is augmented using albumentations library to increase the diversity of the data. The model is trained for a total of 25 epochs with a batch size of 16.

# Evaluation
The model is evaluated on a test set of human images and their corresponding masks. The evaluation is done by visually inspecting the output masks generated by the model and comparing them with the ground truth masks.
